//most of the code written before this section is synchronous(line by line execution)
//In synchronous each line of code waits for the previous line of code to be executed.
//for eg when an alert is executed we cannot do anything anything on webpage untill ok is selected this can reduce the speed of the code
when next line of code waits untill that scenario is completed
//for eg setTimeout() is aynchoronus/non blocking code
